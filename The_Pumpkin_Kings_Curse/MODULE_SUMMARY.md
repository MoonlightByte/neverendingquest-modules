# The Pumpkin King’s Curse - Module Summary

## Overview
A cursed harvest festival erupts into chaos as the Pumpkin King rises, forcing the party to battle folk-horror terrors and break an ancient pact before the village is lost forever.

- **Resource Desperation** (local): With chaos erupting, vital supplies (food, healing draughts, the Ember Gourd) are hoarded, hidden, or threatened with destruction by panicked NPCs and rampaging monsters.

## Getting Started
1. Players start in Greenfields Vale
2. Initial quest hook: The party arrives in Greenfields Vale as the annual harvest festival is reaching its peak on the bustling Harvest Festival Green. Townsfolk celebrate with music, games, and abundant food, but beneath the surface, a nervous tension lingers. Mayor Tilda Bramble welcomes the adventurers warmly, but subtly steers conversation away from certain traditions—especially any mention of the scarecrow effigies or the festival’s origins. The players sense unease in the crowds and are soon approached by villagers with troubling rumors of strange sights in the fields at night and children plagued by nightmares.
